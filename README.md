#Image Classification on Fashion-MNIST

In this notebook, we build a convolutional neural network on tensorflow to classify Fashion-MNIST, which is a dataset of Zalando's article images (https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). This dataset consists of a training set and a validation set, each of which contains 60,000 and 10,000 examples, respectively. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, assigned labels from 10 different classes. Fashion-MNIST is a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST digit dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure as training and testing splits.
